I’m Aayush Dalal, a computer science student at the University of Oklahoma with a strong focus on Generative AI, machine learning, and software engineering. My experience spans from building neural networks and transformers from scratch in PyTorch to optimizing LLM inference using high-performance computing resources. I’ve also developed automation systems using Python, Ansible plugins, Confluence APIs, YAML, and JSON, and I’m certified across AWS Cloud, AI, and professional-level Python programming. My technical toolkit includes CUDA, C/C++, Java, PL/SQL, ETL pipelines, Tableau, and full data-science workflows using EDA, modeling, and visualization.

Beyond research, I’ve led and contributed to diverse projects across data analytics, software development, and agentic AI. As a Senior Data Analytics Intern, I worked internationally to analyze large datasets, build predictive models, and create insights using Oracle APEX, Python, and Node.js. I’ve completed multiple industry simulations (BCG, British Airways, TATA, EA Sports) and built software ranging from a full assembly-based hexadecimal arithmetic program to advanced AI-driven analysis pipelines. I’m driven by solving complex system-level problems and creating scalable, intelligent solutions at the intersection of AI, data, and engineering.
